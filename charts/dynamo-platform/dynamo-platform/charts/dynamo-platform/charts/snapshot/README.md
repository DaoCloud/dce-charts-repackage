# Snapshot Helm Chart

> Experimental feature. The agent runs as a privileged DaemonSet to perform
> CRIU checkpoint and restore operations.

This chart installs the snapshot infrastructure:

- the operator Deployment that reconciles `SnapshotJob`, `PodSnapshot`, and
  `PodSnapshotContent`
- the agent DaemonSet on eligible GPU nodes
- `snapshot-pvc`, or wiring to an existing PVC
- cluster-scoped agent and operator RBAC
- the seccomp profile CRIU needs

Install one Snapshot release for the cluster. Every node agent mounts the same
shared checkpoint PVC directly and watches checkpoint/restore pods in all
namespaces. Workload pods never mount checkpoint storage.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with x86_64 GPU nodes
- NVIDIA GPU Operator 26.3 or newer, with NVIDIA driver 580.xx or newer
- **containerd** or **CRI-O** (chart defaults to containerd; see below for CRI-O / OpenShift)
- a cluster where a privileged DaemonSet with `hostPID`, `hostIPC`, and `hostNetwork` is acceptable

The checkpoint PVC must support `ReadWriteMany` because agents on multiple nodes
mount it concurrently. Chart-created claims always request `ReadWriteMany` and
are retained when the Helm release is removed.

An existing `ReadWriteOnce` claim cannot be upgraded in place because PVC access
modes are immutable. When `storage.pvc.create=false`, the chart assumes the named
existing claim supports `ReadWriteMany`; verify its access mode before installing
or upgrading. To migrate, create a new RWX claim, copy the retained checkpoint
data once if it must be preserved, then set `storage.pvc.create=false` and
`storage.pvc.name` to the new claim. The old retained claim remains untouched.

When using AWS EFS, make sure a reused static PV references a real EFS file
system ID and has mount targets reachable from every GPU node. A placeholder
such as `fs-xxxx` can bind a PVC but the snapshot agent will not start because
the node cannot mount it.

## OpenShift installation

OpenShift uses CRI-O. Install with `runtime.type=crio` and
`openshift.enabled=true`. The OpenShift setting creates the SCC-use RBAC and
required-SCC pod annotations for both components: the agent uses the
`privileged` SCC and the operator uses `anyuid`. Keep `rbac.create=true` (the
default); otherwise, create equivalent SCC-use RBAC separately. The agent uses
public GHCR images by default and does not need an image pull secret; configure
`daemonset.imagePullSecrets` only for a private image override. When upgrading a
release that uses a private agent image, set the private registry pull secret in
the same Helm upgrade so the new chart defaults do not remove the required image
access.

Create a checkpoint PVC through an RWX-capable StorageClass, such as an EFS
StorageClass:

```bash
export RWX_STORAGE_CLASS=efs-rwx

helm upgrade --install snapshot ./charts/snapshot \
  --namespace "${NAMESPACE}" --create-namespace \
  --set storage.pvc.create=true \
  --set storage.pvc.storageClass="${RWX_STORAGE_CLASS}" \
  --set runtime.type=crio \
  --set openshift.enabled=true
```

Or reuse an existing RWX PVC in the installation namespace:

```bash
export EXISTING_RWX_PVC=snapshot-efs-pvc

helm upgrade --install snapshot ./charts/snapshot \
  --namespace "${NAMESPACE}" --create-namespace \
  --set storage.pvc.create=false \
  --set storage.pvc.name="${EXISTING_RWX_PVC}" \
  --set runtime.type=crio \
  --set openshift.enabled=true
```

## Minimal install

Create the checkpoint PVC and the agent:

```bash
helm upgrade --install snapshot ./charts/snapshot \
  --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
  --create-namespace \
  --set storage.pvc.create=true
```

If your cluster does not use a default storage class, also set
`storage.pvc.storageClass`.

Reuse an existing PVC instead:

```bash
helm upgrade --install snapshot ./charts/snapshot \
  --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
  --create-namespace \
  --set storage.pvc.create=false \
  --set storage.pvc.name=my-snapshot-pvc
```

## CRD upgrades

Helm creates the CRDs in [crds/](./crds) on a fresh install and then leaves them
alone: `helm upgrade` never updates them. To close that gap the operator
Deployment runs a `crd-installer` init container before the manager starts. It
server-side applies the CRDs embedded in the `api` module — the same manifests
`make generate` mirrors into `crds/` — so every rollout converges the cluster on
definitions the running binary agrees with. Nothing to update means nothing is
written:

```bash
kubectl logs deployment/snapshot-operator -n ${NAMESPACE} -c crd-installer
```

```text
Applied CRD  {"name": "podsnapshots.nvidia.com", "action": "unchanged"}
Applied CRD  {"name": "podsnapshotcontents.nvidia.com", "action": "unchanged"}
Applied CRD  {"name": "snapshotjobs.nvidia.com", "action": "unchanged"}
CRDs already up to date, no changes applied  {"count": 3}
```

The installer runs whenever the operator pod is recreated, which a `helm upgrade`
does as soon as the image tag moves — `image.operator.tag` defaults to the
chart's `appVersion`, so a release that changes the CRDs changes the tag too. If
you pin a mutable tag such as `latest`, rebuilding it does not change the pod
spec and nothing rolls; restart the Deployment yourself to pick up new
definitions.

`rbac.create=true` grants the operator ServiceAccount `get`/`patch` on the three
CRDs in [crds/](./crds) by name, plus an unscoped `create` — RBAC cannot match
`resourceNames` on create, so that verb only ever lets the operator add a CRD,
never modify one it does not own.

Set `crdUpgrade.enabled=false` when CRDs are managed out of band, for example by
GitOps or by a cluster admin who does not want the operator holding
`apiextensions` permissions. That drops the init container and the extra RBAC —
and makes updating the CRDs your responsibility after every chart upgrade:

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts -f ./charts/snapshot/crds/
```

## Verify

```bash
PVC_NAME="${PVC_NAME:-snapshot-pvc}" # match storage.pvc.name
kubectl get pvc "${PVC_NAME}" -n "${NAMESPACE}"
kubectl rollout status daemonset/snapshot-agent -n ${NAMESPACE}
kubectl get pods -n ${NAMESPACE} -l app.kubernetes.io/name=snapshot -o wide
```

snapshot backends, but only `pvc` is implemented today.

See [values.yaml](./values.yaml) for the full configuration surface.

## Uninstall

```bash
helm uninstall snapshot -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

The chart does not delete checkpoint data automatically. Remove the PVC yourself
if you want to clear stored checkpoints:

```bash
PVC_NAME="${PVC_NAME:-snapshot-pvc}" # match storage.pvc.name
kubectl delete pvc "${PVC_NAME}" -n "${NAMESPACE}"
```
