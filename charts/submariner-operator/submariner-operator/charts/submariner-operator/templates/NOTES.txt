Submariner is now installed.

{{- if .Values.gateway.nodeSelectorEnabled }}
If you haven't done so yet, please label a node as `submariner.io/gateway=true` to elect it for running Submariner.
{{- end }}

By default, Submariner runs with 1 replica. If you have more than one Gateway host, you can scale Submariner to N replicas, and the other Submariner pods will simply join the leader election pool.
