                              the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                              implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                              weights does not need to equal 100.

                              If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                              of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no

                              the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                              implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                              weights does not need to equal 100.

                              If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                              of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
                              traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight

                      Matching requests will receive a 401 Unauthorized response instead of being redirected.

                                Name is the name of the HTTP Header to be matched. Name matching MUST be
                                case-insensitive. (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2).

                                If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered
                                equivalent.
