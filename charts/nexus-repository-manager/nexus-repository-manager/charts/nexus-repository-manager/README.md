# ⚠️ Archive Notice

As of October 24, 2023, we will no longer update or support this Helm chart.

We now provide one [HA/Resiliency Helm Chart](https://github.com/sonatype/nxrm3-ha-repository/tree/main/nxrm-ha) that supports both high availability and resilient deployments in AWS, Azure, or on-premises in a Kubernetes cluster. This is our only supported Helm chart for deploying Sonatype Nexus Repository; it requires a PostgreSQL database.
